Find all services:
    $ dns-sd -B _services._dns-sd._udp local

I can fake a target by copying it's Bonjour announce to another system and replay it there again.
About Hash: remains static
    Not H.: Content of cname
    Not H.: Hostname
    Not H.: Hardware Address (I guess)
    Not H.: Name of Bonjour Service

If length of cname is changed, bonjour registration will fail.
